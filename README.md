# SharedCircle

Hi everyone! I'm Izi, and I'm excited to introduce SharedCircle, my innovative project for the NERO Chain Wavehack. SharedCircle is a simple, gas-free group wallet built on NERO Chain. Whether you're splitting rent with roommates, saving with friends, or managing a community fund, SharedCircle makes it easy to co-own and manage crypto together, no technical skills needed.

# What's SharedCircle All About?

SharedCircle lets multiple people:
- Create a shared crypto wallet in seconds
- Add friends or family via invite
- Propose how to use the money (like “Saving for a particular expenses”)
- Vote on each proposal
- Send, receive, and manage funds without paying gas fees

It's all powered by NERO Chain’s Paymaster and Account Abstraction, so everything just works like a regular app.

# The Problem It Solves
Crypto is powerful, but group money management is still clunky and expensive. Most wallets aren’t built for:
- Families or close friends pooling funds
- Communities or DAOs managing shared treasuries
- People new to Web3 who don’t want to deal with gas or complexity

SharedCircle fixes this with a smooth Web2-like experience and zero gas drama.

#  How It Works (User Flow)
1. **Start a Circle** – One person creates a group wallet and gives it a name.
2. **Invite Others** – Send invite links to add members.
3. **Add Funds** – Everyone deposits what they want.
4. **Propose & Vote** – Any member can suggest how to use the funds. Everyone votes.
5. **Execute** – Approved proposals are executed, no one pays gas.

# Why NERO Chain?

We’re using NERO’s features to make everything simple:
- **Account Abstraction:** Each group gets a smart wallet with custom logic
- **Paymaster:** Users don’t need ETH or MATIC to interact, gas is covered or paid in their own token
- **No-Code Configs:** Set up how gas works right from a dashboard, no devs needed

# Tech Overview

Here's an overview of my plan for building SharedCircle:
- **Frontend:** React + ethers.js
- **Contracts:** Solidity, AA-compatible wallets
- **Backend (light):** Node/Express for proposal logic
- **NERO Tools:** Paymaster SDK, No-code gas dashboard

We’re excited to prototype this and grow it with community feedback. Over the next waves, we’ll refine the UX, add real use cases, and explore long-term sustainability.

# What We’re Planning

Wave 1: Share the idea globally and gather feedbacks

Wave 2(MVP Build):
- Build shared wallet smart contract
- Plug in Paymaster for gasless transactions
- Launch basic frontend for easy use

Wave 3(Smarter UX):
- Add in-app chat + AI savings suggestions
- Real-time alerts and vote reminders

Wave 4(Ready for the World):
- Testnet launch
- Community onboarding, token incentives
- Explore app store or wallet extension

# Why It’s Worth Building

This isn’t just a wallet. SharedCircle brings real people into Web3, like parents, neighbors, students, small communities all without the usual friction. It’s Web3 made for everyone, not just crypto natives. Therefore, this is a movement in reshaping how value and content are shared on-chain. Let's build the future together with **#SharedCircle**!
