# SharedCircle Mockups

I'm excited to share what SharedCircle will look like! For Wave 1, I've created a quick vision of the UI, focusing on seamless social contribution and engagement. Imagine a clean, connected, and purposeful design that lets users support causes, create shared moments, and grow their impactâ€”all gas-free thanks to NERO's Paymaster.

This is just the beginning, and I'll continue building it out in Wave 2
