# SharedCircle User Flow

Hey, I’m Izi, and this is how SharedCircle will work for users. I want judges and the NERO community to see exactly what it feels like to use this Web3-powered subscription and content-sharing platform. It’s designed to be simple, gas-free, and creator-first, so anyone can engage, support, and grow with their favorite communities.

## The Vision
The vision is about redefining how creators and communities connect, share, and thrive in the Web3 era — without the complexity that usually holds people back.

## Usert Flow Guide
1. **Explore & Discover**
- User visits SharedCircle via web or mobile.
- Browses a feed of featured creators or communities.
- Clicks into a creator profile to see their exclusive content and subscription tiers.

2. **Quick Signup / Connect**
- User signs up via email or social login (wallet creation happens in the background via AA).
- A NERO-compatible smart wallet is generated for the user (gasless UX).

3. **Choose Subscription**
- User selects a subscription tier (monthly or annual).
- Payment is made in any token (Paymaster handles token-to-gas logic).
- No visible wallet popups or transaction signing required — it’s Web2-smooth.

4. **Access Premium Content**
- Once payment is confirmed, access to gated content (videos, posts, files, links) is unlocked.
- Content is stored via IPFS or Arweave, with access permissions handled by smart contracts.

5. **Engage with Creator / Community**
- User can *comment*, join gated chatrooms, or attend virtual events.
- Creators can airdrop perks, NFTs, or offer shoutouts to loyal subscribers.

6. **Manage Account**
- Users can view their active subscriptions, update tokens, or cancel anytime.
- Everything is managed from a simple dashboard — no Web3 literacy required.

7. **Share & Grow**
- Users share their favorite creators to friends.
- Referrals can be incentivized via smart contract-based affiliate/reward systems.
