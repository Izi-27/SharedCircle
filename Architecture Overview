# SharedCircle Architecture Overview

Introducing SharedCircle on NERO Chain! Without getting too technical, here's the vision: SharedCircle's vision is to bridge the gap between Web2 familiarity and Web3 innovation, empowering anyone to create, engage, and thrive in a borderless digital ecosystem; free from gas fees and complex onboarding, all made possible by NERO's Paymaster. This is the high-level plan for Wave 1, with development to follow in Wave 2.

## System Overview
