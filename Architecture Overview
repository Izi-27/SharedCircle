# SharedCircle Architecture Overview

Introducing SharedCircle on NERO Chain! Without getting too technical, here's the vision: SharedCircle's vision is to bridge the gap between Web2 familiarity and Web3 innovation, empowering anyone to create, engage, and thrive in a borderless digital ecosystem; free from gas fees and complex onboarding, all made possible by NERO's Paymaster. This is the high-level plan for Wave 1, with development to follow in Wave 2.

## System Overview

SharedCircle is a decentralized content subscription platform built on NERO Chain, designed to allow creators to monetize exclusive content while offering users a seamless Web2-like experience, thanks to the Paymaster (AA-platform) integration. The main system components are listed below:

1. **Frontend (User Interface)**
   - Built with React/Next.js
   - Handles:
     - Creator registration & content upload
     - Subscriber content access & token-based access validation
     - Wallet & social logins
     - Gasless transaction prompts

2. **Backend API Layer**
   - Powered by Node.js/Express
   - Manages:
     - Authentication/session management
     - Creator dashboards and analytics
     - Subscription and payment metadata
     - Integration with smart contracts

3. **Smart Contracts on NERO Chain**
   - Written in Solidity
   - Functions:
     - Tiered subscription models (Basic, Premium)
     - Access control via token/NFT ownership
     - Secure payment processing
     - Logs transactions and interactions on-chain

4. **Paymaster (AA-Platform) Integration**
   - Core to user experience:
     - Sponsors gas fees (gasless UX)
     - Supports custom token payments
     - Implements account abstraction logic
     - Managed via no-code dashboard on NERO

5. **Content Storage (Off-chain)**
   - Stored on IPFS/Arweave
   - Ensures:
     - Decentralized and censorship-resistant content
     - Hashes referenced in smart contracts for validation

6. **Analytics & Notifications (Optional)**
   - Tools: Google Analytics, Email/Telegram
   - Features:
     - Track user engagement
     - Alert users of new uploads or subscription changes

This setup perfectly meets the 30% AA Integration criteria by seemlessly blending Web3 with Web2. A visual diagram in canva will be added in wave2.

## Why This Works

- **Simplicity**: Users interact through a Web2-like interface with no wallet or gas complexity.
- **Scalability**: Modular design allows the app to grow with new features or services over time.
- **Security**: Smart contracts enforce transparent payments and access control.
- **Decentralization**: Content is hosted via IPFS/Arweave, not centralized servers.
- **Flexibility**: Custom gas logic through NERO Paymaster supports various tokens and UX flows.
- **User-Centric**: Built for non-crypto natives, ensuring wider adoption and better retention.

Wave 1 planning complete. Wave 2 will focus on coding contracts and frontend development. More details in [README.md](README.md) and [USER_FLOW.md](USER_FLOW.md)
